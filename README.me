Hey you reached my github! For about a year i have been managing companies, specifically managing databases and online server issues/tasks. I work with development teams and i am interested in how they work etc. Within this year i have been taking in information and making small projects closely related to these. Now i have some spare time, to work on my own projects and take things more seriously than before. I'll be learning JavaScript, along with PHP, and C++, I have some past experience with JS and C++, however PHP is very new to me!
